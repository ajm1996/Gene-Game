Thank you for checking out this game!

This readme will serve as a quick tutorial for the gameplay.

==============================================================

This game works as a survival simulation roguelike, where you are indirectly guiding a colony of drones as they gather food and reproduce.
Your drones have extremely short lifespans, but they are able to breed and pass on traits that will be beneficial for their children.

The game begins by allowing you to select a location to travel to. Different locations will have different amounts of food and different trait rewards available.
When you travel to a location, before you can reap the rewards there your drones will have to fight enemy drones. Combat is automatic and does not require any
user input. When combat ends, if your drones are still alive, you will move on to a breeding screen where you can breed your drones with eachother. Drones have lifespans
of only a single day, so any non-bred drones will not be able to continue on. After breeding is completed, you will return to the traversal menu and select a new location.

See how far you can get!
